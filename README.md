# Covid-Spread
Visualisations for the spread of Covid represented on the world map

This was done as a project for one of my courses in my Data Science Masters around May 2020. The entire project was done in collaboration with Anna Kaplan.
The project had 2 parts:
1) Represent the spread of Covid in GIF form
2) Create a Shiny App to present the Covid Data
Note that there may have been changes to the input files since then that will require small tweaks to the programmes here.
